# HMT
A easy to use GUI tool that lets you switch the entire gui framework you use without needing to change (almost) anything!

---

  An "simpel" interface to make GUIs that can be translated into any GUI framework that it supports

  Currently supported GUI:
      tk
      cutsomtkenter
      dearpygui
  
  You can moddify this code how you want but just know I'm not the best and this is probbaly bad code to most standards,
  if you do please just give some credit.

... And no I dont remeber what HMT meant, I made it at some point but idr :/
